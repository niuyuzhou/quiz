When you run the current application and input http://localhost:8080/greeting, it will return {"id":1,"content":"Hello, World!"}

Please implement the below REST API:

Usage: to find the total numbers of the users with the name searched

URL: http://localhost:8080/user

Body: {"name": "Tom"}
// Tom is example, you could use the name like John, emily and so on.

Method: POST

Return: {name": "Tom", "TotalNumbers": ??}
  // name should be what you got by Body
  // ?? should be the actual numbers of users whose name is what you searched

It should be finished based on the current framework.

You should think it's a real requirement so you could consider all the cases that would happen.

You need to finish it using the current framework
Controller -> UserService -> dao (having been finished)

You need to login with your own github account(if you don't have please create one) and then fork a branch from the master branch of mine. After you finish you could commit a pull request to master branch of mine.
